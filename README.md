_**SkillSwap Platform**_

The main idea includes developing a mini application that enables users to list their skills  
and request others in return.

## Problem Statement

Many individuals have valuable skills to offer but lack a platform to exchange those skills in a structured and mutually beneficial manner.  
The goal is to create a SkillSwap platform where users can:
- List the skills they are willing to offer.
- Browse skills offered by others.
- Make mutual requests to exchange skills.
